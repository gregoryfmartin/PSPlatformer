# PSPlatformer

A platformer? In PowerShell? ARE U NUTS!?

Turns out, yeah, I am.

## What Even Is This?

I've spent the past few years working on Eldoria, a PowerShell RPG game, and I needed to take a break from it. This is what happened.

Not like this is a HUGE accomplishment or anything like that, but it's just good fun. A way for me to write some code that myself and others can enjoy at their leisure.

The goal is simple: move your character to the X (because it marks the spot, duh).

## Yeah, But What About The "Game"?

This is a Git repository with source code in it. You have it, you do whatever you want with it. Plain and simple. It's MIT licensed, so I don't really care.

Wanna fork? Go ahead.

Wanna do a PR? Go ahead.

Wanna repeat the same level over and over again? Go ahead.

Wanna _not_ play PSPlatformer? Go ahead.

Got ideas but don't want to write the code? Let's talk!

Wanna send me all your hard-earned cash? Please.

## How Do I Get Started Programming?

I did a pair-programming session with Andrew Pla on PowerShell Wednesdays where we not only reviewed the code to an extent, but squashed some issues in the issue tracker on the repository. If you're a video learner, this would be a good place to start.

If you want something to read along to, check out the repository wiki (WIP ATM).

Fortunately, the code is _extremely_ simple to follow along with. If you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out!
